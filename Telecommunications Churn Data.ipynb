    "## Scenario: Telecommunications Churn\n",
    "In the telecommunications industry, customers can choose from multiple service providers\n",
    "and actively switch from one provider to another. Customer “churn” is defined as the\n",
    "percentage of customers who stopped using a provider’s product or service during a certain\n",
    "time frame. In this highly competitive market, some telecommunications industries can\n",
    "experience average annual churn rates as high as 25 percent. Given that it costs 10 times\n",
    "more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now\n",
    "become even more important than customer acquisition.\n",
    "\n",
    "For many providers, retaining highly profitable customers is the number one business goal.\n",
    "To reduce customer churn, telecommunications companies need to predict which customers\n",
    "are at high risk of churn."

    "To identify anomalies in the data set, we will be first cleaning up the data. I will remove unneeded variables and and be renaming some variables so they will be easier to read. I will rename the 'Items 1-8' variables to their actual meanings as this will make it significantly easier to read without needed to constantly refer back to the descriptions. We will then find the anomalies in the data though visualization such as box and whisker plots and histograms.\n",

We should then be able to discover which variables equate to a high likelihood of a customer churning. To assess the quality of specific variables, we will see how much each variable correlates to churn. For example, some variables may have absolutely no impact on churn, and therefore these variables really do not matter to us.\n",

    "In this analysis, we will be using Python. Python is great for data analytics and cleaning. It makes it very simple to do what you need to do, to get actionable insights out of the data. Python also has many packages to add abilities that base Python may not contain. For example, we will also be using Pandas for out dataset to create a Pandas Dataframe and numpy to add in even more functionality for data analysis. We will also be using matplotlib and seaborn for visualization."
